# AI Agent & Automation Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights selected AI agents, workflows and automation projects I’ve designed with **MindStudio**.  

Each project explores how applied AI can support learning, research, or workflow automation.

Repos include documentation, sample outputs, and demo assets. Demos are available upon request.
