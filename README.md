# AI & Automation Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights selected AI workflows and automation projects Iâ€™ve designed with **MindStudio** and other tools.  
Each project explores how applied AI can support learning, research, and workflow automation.

Most live agents are not exposed â€” repos include documentation, sample outputs, and demo assets. Demos are available upon request.
